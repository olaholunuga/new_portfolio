  "personal_story": "I discovered my passion for programming during college when I built my first web application. What started as curiosity quickly became an obsession with creating digital solutions that make people's lives easier. Over the past 3+ years, I've had the privilege of working with startups and established companies, building everything from MVPs to enterprise-scale applications. Each project has taught me something new and reinforced my belief that great software is built with both technical excellence and deep empathy for users. When I'm not coding, you'll find me contributing to open source projects, mentoring fellow developers, or exploring the latest technologies. I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge with the community.",
